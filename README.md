# Mental Health Therapist AI



## Overview

Mental health issues are increasingly recognized as critical for overall well-being. However, access to mental health support can be limited due to various factors such as stigma, cost, and availability. This project aims to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to create a mental health therapist that mimics real-world therapists, providing accessible, immediate, and confidential support for individuals seeking mental health assistance.

## Features

- **Mimic Real-Life Therapist**: Utilizes conversational techniques of the OpenAI model to replicate the interaction style of a real-life therapist, creating a more engaging and realistic experience for users.
- **Preliminary User Analysis**: Provides an initial analysis of the user's mental state based on their responses, offering insights that can guide further interaction or suggest appropriate resources.
- **Empathetic Conversations**: Engages users in empathetic and supportive dialogues, aiming to provide comfort and reduce feelings of isolation.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Employs advanced prompt engineering techniques using the OpenAI API to enhance the quality of interactions, ensuring responses are contextually relevant and supportive.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: For the user interface.
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3 API for leveraging AI capabilities.
- **Python**: Programming language used in the production of the MVP.
